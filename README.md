# vue-text-editor
This project is a simple Rich text editor made with vue 2 compostion API. I chose for not use `document.execComand` because he is deprecated. So I using native javascript DOM manipulators to remove and insert nodes. You can se it working [here](https://edumudu.github.io/vue-text-editor/).
